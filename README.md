## Running the Application
You must have an installation of Go in order to run the application. Run the following command within the application's directory:
```sh
go run app.go

This command will start the server and accept traffic on port 1111. 

The API can be accessed from `localhost:1111` and includes `GET` and `POST` http methods to the `/metadata` resource.
